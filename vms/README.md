# Virtual Machines

We will need to set up at least 2 (ideally 3) VMs for our distributed systems

> On 12/10 we tried doing this it using desktop VMs using VirtualBox/Hyper-V, but that proved difficult and unreliable.  Gerry updated our [VirtualBox](../VirtualBox.md) page with some new links, but perhaps doing this on a public cloud would be better

>
There is a [Task Page](../tasks/README.md) with several TO-DO tasks looking for volunteers.  
* Items 1-3 are regarding documenting public cloud options 
    * The folk researching public cloud VMs will also report on costs for basic VMs with at least 4Gb RAM and 25Gb Disk
    * see [Task Page](../tasks/README.md) for more details
* Item 4 is about documenting VirtualBox
  * see [Task Page](../tasks/README.md) for more 

Ideally we will settle on a public cloud option before next week and send people instructions.
